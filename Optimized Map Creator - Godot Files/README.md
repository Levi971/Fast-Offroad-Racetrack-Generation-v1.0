# (Not Totally) Optimized Proceduraly Generated Offroad Track 

It's just a project that I started yesterday, even if in reality, I started working on the creation of procedural routes much longer ago, now, I'm looking to optimize the algorithm in question to make it more quick, I tried to make it work from the editor, but I don't know why but it doesn't work very well, so to follow...

And yes, since I have already been working for quite some time with other projects, there is a lot of copy and paste in the code, but I will make the code more compact and easy to follow later.
